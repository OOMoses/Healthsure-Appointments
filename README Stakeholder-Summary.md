## 1. Background and Project Context
**Company:** HealthSure Clinics (Brazil outpatient network)  
**Stakeholder:** Head of Operations  
**Challenge:** High no-show rates (~80%) are creating operational strain and lost revenue, with attendance stuck near 20%.  
**Goal:** Identify **who**, **where**, and **when** no-shows happen; recommend targeted actions to improve attendance, efficiency, and equity.  

---

## 2. Data Structure Overview
Analysis powered by **110,527 appointment records** enriched with geographic & socioeconomic data.  

**Star Schema Model:**  
- **Fact Table:** `appointments_fact` â€“ Appointment-level data (dates, patient, conditions, attendance status)  
- **Dimensions:**  
  - `patient_dim` â€“ Demographics, social welfare status  
  - `location_dim` â€“ Neighbourhood, administrative region, zone, socioeconomic status

- **Demographic Risks:** Older patients (60â€“79) â†’ 85% miss rate; diabetic/hypertensive patients â†’ 82%+ miss rate  
- **Time-of-Day Effect:** Mornings (7â€“9 a.m.) â†’ ~83% miss rate; evenings â†’ ~70%  
- **Wait Time Effect:** No-shows wait ~9 days longer on average  
- **Loyalty Gap:** Only 39% return for repeat visits  
- **Reminder Weakness:** Single SMS reminders have minimal effect; multiple touchpoints perform better

## 4. Insights Deep Dive

| Insight | What We Found | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High-Risk Neighbourhoods | Santa Martha, Tabuazeiro, Jardim da Penha lead in no-show volume & rate | Targeting these 3 could recover **8K+ visits annually** |
| Older Patients | 85% miss rate for 60â€“79 age group | Age-specific barriers need to be addressed |
| Chronic Conditions | Diabetes: 82.7% miss, Hypertension: 82.6% | These patients often need ongoing follow-up |
| Time-of-Day Effect | AM slots: ~83% miss; PM slots: ~70% miss | Shifting capacity could improve utilisation |
| Wait Time Impact | No-shows wait 21.5 days; attendees wait 12.3 days | Shorter waits = higher attendance |
| Retention | Only 4 in 10 return | Loyalty programs are underused |

## 5. Recommendations
1. **Target Top 3 Neighbourhoods:** Transport support, flexible scheduling, multi-touch reminders.  
2. **Condition-Specific Outreach:** Pre-book follow-ups for older/chronic patients before they leave the clinic.  
3. **Rebalance Appointment Slots:** Move ~15% of morning slots to evening.  
4. **Reduce Wait Times:** Cap at 14 days for high-risk groups.  
5. **Build a Loyalty Program:** Priority booking & follow-up for returning patients.  
6. **Redesign Reminders:** Test frequency, timing, and format to boost attendance.

## 6. Technical Implementation
- **SQL (MySQL):** Data cleaning, indexing, star schema design
- **Data Enrichment:** Mapping locations to regions, zones, and socioeconomic classes
- **Power BI:** Branded dashboard with mobile-friendly navigation
- **Storytelling Framework:** WHAT WE FOUNDâ€“WHAT TO DO applied for insight presentation

## 7. Caveats & Assumptions
- Data is historical and may not reflect recent operational changes
- Some patient data (e.g., chronic conditions) is self-reported
- Socioeconomic levels based on neighbourhood averages

## 8. Business Impact
Implementing these changes could:  
- Recover **thousands of missed visits annually**  
- Improve **operational efficiency & staff utilisation**  
- Enhance **equity outcomes** in underserved communities
