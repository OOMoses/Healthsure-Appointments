## 1. Background and Project Context
**Company:** HealthSure Clinics (Brazil outpatient network)  
**Stakeholder:** Head of Operations  
**Challenge:** High no-show rates (~80%) are creating operational strain and lost revenue, with attendance stuck near 20%.  
**Goal:** Identify **who**, **where**, and **when** no-shows happen; recommend targeted actions to improve attendance, efficiency, and equity.  

---

## 2. Data Structure Overview
Analysis powered by **110,527 appointment records** enriched with geographic & socioeconomic data.  

**Star Schema Model:**  
- **Fact Table:** `appointments_fact` ‚Äì Appointment-level data (dates, patient, conditions, attendance status)  
- **Dimensions:**  
  - `patient_dim` ‚Äì Demographics, social welfare status  
  - `location_dim` ‚Äì Neighbourhood, administrative region, zone, socioeconomic status

## 3. Executive Summary  

HealthSure Clinics faces a **critical no-show problem**: nearly **8 in 10 appointments are missed**, costing the clinic lost revenue and reducing patient access to care.  

**Key Insights:**  
- üìç **Geographic Hotspots:** Santa Martha (84.2%) and Tabuazeiro (81.7%) show the worst attendance.  
- üë• **Demographic Risks:** Older patients (60‚Äì79) and those with diabetes/hypertension are most at risk (>82% miss rates).  
- ‚è∞ **Time-of-Day Effect:** Mornings (7‚Äì9 a.m.) show ~83% no-shows; evenings perform better (~70%) but are underutilized.  
- üïí **Wait Time Effect:** No-shows waited ~9 days longer (21.5 vs 12.3 days).  
- üîÑ **Loyalty Gap:** Only 39% of patients return for repeat visits.  
- üì≤ **Reminder Weakness:** Single SMS reminders are ineffective; multiple touchpoints deliver better results.

## 4. Insights Deep Dive

| Insight | What We Found | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High-Risk Neighbourhoods | Santa Martha, Tabuazeiro, Jardim da Penha lead in no-show volume & rate | Targeting these 3 could recover **8K+ visits annually** |
| Older Patients | 85% miss rate for 60‚Äì79 age group | Age-specific barriers need to be addressed |
| Chronic Conditions | Diabetes: 82.7% miss, Hypertension: 82.6% | These patients often need ongoing follow-up |
| Time-of-Day Effect | AM slots: ~83% miss; PM slots: ~70% miss | Shifting capacity could improve utilisation |
| Wait Time Impact | No-shows wait 21.5 days; attendees wait 12.3 days | Shorter waits = higher attendance |
| Retention | Only 4 in 10 return | Loyalty programs are underused |

## 5. Recommendations  

To address these challenges, we recommend a **5-point action plan**:  

1. **Neighborhood Targeting** ‚Äì Focus first on Santa Martha, Tabuazeiro, and Jardim da Penha with **transport support, flexible scheduling, and multi-touch reminders**.  
2. **Condition-Specific Outreach** ‚Äì Pre-book follow-ups for older patients and those with chronic illnesses before they leave the clinic.  
3. **Rebalance Appointment Slots** ‚Äì Shift **~15% of morning slots to evenings** to improve utilization.  
4. **Reduce Wait Times** ‚Äì Cap waits at **‚â§14 days** for high-risk patients.  
5. **Build Loyalty & Improve Reminders** ‚Äì Launch a **priority rebooking program** for past attendees and test **multi-touch reminder strategies** (e.g., SMS + calls).  

*‚ö° **Impact:** Implementing these changes could recover **thousands of missed visits annually**, improve operational efficiency, and strengthen equity for vulnerable patient groups.*

## 6. Technical Implementation
- **SQL (MySQL):** Data cleaning, indexing, star schema design
- **Data Enrichment:** Mapping locations to regions, zones, and socioeconomic classes
- **Power BI:** Branded dashboard with mobile-friendly navigation
- **Storytelling Framework:** WHAT WE FOUND‚ÄìWHAT TO DO applied for insight presentation

## 7. Caveats & Assumptions
- Data is historical and may not reflect recent operational changes
- Some patient data (e.g., chronic conditions) is self-reported
- Socioeconomic levels based on neighbourhood averages

## 8. Business Impact
Implementing these changes could:  
- Recover **thousands of missed visits annually**
