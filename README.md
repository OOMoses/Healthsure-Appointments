## 1. Project Overview
This project simulates an **end-to-end Business Intelligence workflow** for a healthcare organization, *Healthsure Clinic*, aiming to understand and improve patient attendance rates for scheduled appointments.

The project covers:
- **Data acquisition & staging** (MySQL)
- **Data modeling** into a **Star Schema**
- **Data cleaning & enrichment** (Neighborhood ‚Üí Region, Zone, Socioeconomic status)
- **Indexing & referential integrity** for query performance
- **Data visualization & storytelling** in Power BI
- **Actionable insights** for operational improvement

## 2. Business Problem
Missed appointments (no-shows) create significant **financial and operational strain** for healthcare providers, leading to:
- Wasted staff time and resources
- Reduced patient access to care
- Lower operational efficiency

The clinic wanted to **analyze historical appointment patterns** to answer:
- Who misses appointments?
- Where do missed appointments occur most?
- When are appointments most likely to be missed?
- How do socioeconomic factors impact attendance?

---

## 3. Objectives
- Build a **relational database** to store and manage appointment records.
- Create a **fact table** and **dimension tables** for patient, location, and appointment details.
- Enrich location data with **zones** and **socioeconomic status** for deeper analysis.
- Develop an **interactive Power BI report** with filters, KPIs, and visuals for different stakeholders.
- Provide **actionable recommendations** to reduce no-show rates.

---

## 4. Dataset
- **Source:** Public dataset from Brazil's medical appointment records, cleaned and transformed.
- **Size:** 110,527 appointment records.
- **Key Columns:**
    - Appointment ID, Patient ID
    - Scheduled Date, Appointment Date
    - Patient demographics (age, gender, conditions)
    - SMS reminders received
    - Neighborhood, administrative region
    - Appointment status (Show / No-Show)

---

## 5. Technical Workflow

### A. Data Preparation in MySQL
1. **Imported raw CSV into staging table** `stg_appointments`.
2. Standardized column names and data types.
3. Converted text cases for matching (e.g., `NEIGHBOURHOOD` from UPPERCASE ‚Üí Proper Case).
4. Created indexes for faster joins:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_stg_appointments_neighbourhood 
    ON stg_appointments(Neighbourhood);

CREATE INDEX idx_location_neighbourhood 
    ON location_dim(Neighbourhood);
```
### B. Dimensional Modeling
Created a **Star Schema** with:

**Fact Table:**
- `appointments_fact`  
  *(AppointmentID, PatientID, LocationKey, dates, patient conditions, appointment status)*

**Dimension Tables:**
- `patient_dim`  
  *(PatientID, Gender, LocationKey, SocialWelfare)*
- `location_dim`  
  *(LocationKey, Neighbourhood, AdministrativeRegion, Zone, SocioeconomicStatus)*

---

### C. Data Enrichment
- Mapped **Neighborhoods ‚Üí Administrative Regions** using official region data.
- Added `Zone` and `SocioeconomicStatus` columns to `location_dim`.
- Updated `location_dim` via CSV mapping and SQL `UPDATE` statements.

---

### D. Power BI Connection & Transformation
- Connected **Power BI** directly to **MySQL** database.
- Converted `PatientID` and `AppointmentID` to **Text** to avoid scientific notation.
- Kept `LocationKey` as **Integer** for relationship joins.
- Converted **Yes/No** columns into binary flags (0/1) where relevant.
- Dropped redundant columns (e.g., `AppointmentDateTime` ‚Äî always `00:00:00`).
- Renamed columns using underscores for consistency.

---

### E. Dashboard Development

**Theme & Branding:**
- Custom **JSON theme** using clinic's brand colors:
  - Dark Purple `#4b3988` (Text)
  - Light Purple `#433476` (Graphics)
  - Red `#cf3136`
  - Pink `#E37F7C`
- Consistent typography, iconography, and layout.
- Navigation buttons with tooltips for multi-page navigation.
- Mobile-optimized layouts for all pages.

**Navigation:**
- Multi-page report with **Previous/Next** page navigation.
- Tooltips explaining navigation purpose.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Key Features of the Solution
- **Role-specific insights:** Pages tailored for executives, operations managers, and outreach teams.
- **Dynamic filtering:** By gender, socioeconomic status, age group, region, and zone.
- **Trend & distribution analysis:** Patterns over time, by location, and patient demographics.
- **Performance metrics:** No-show rates, show rates, and top/bottom performing areas.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Power BI Pages Overview
1. **Executive Summary** ‚Äì KPIs, top-level trends, and filters.
2. **Access & Equity** ‚Äì Socioeconomic and regional disparities.
3. **Patient Profiles** ‚Äì Demographic & health condition patterns.
4. **Scheduling Patterns** ‚Äì Booking timing and wait time effects.
5. **Repeat Visits & Loyalty** ‚Äì Retention and attendance behavior.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Insights & Recommendations

**Example 1:**  
AND: Most appointments occur in middle-income neighborhoods AND attendance rates are generally above 75%.  
BUT: Low-income zones show a significantly higher no-show rate (~35%).  
THEREFORE: Target low-income areas with outreach campaigns and flexible scheduling options.

**Example 2:**  
AND: Patients with hypertension are a large portion of the clinic's population.  
BUT: They have slightly higher no-show rates compared to non-hypertensive patients.  
THEREFORE: Implement a follow-up reminder specifically for chronic patients.
